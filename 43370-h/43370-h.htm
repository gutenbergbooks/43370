<h2>Candy-Making at Home</h2>



<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR CANDY-MAKING</div>


<p><span class="smcap">We</span> find it quite possible to make just as delicious
candy at home as can be bought of the
most famous manufacturers. Of course there
are a few kinds of candies that can be made only
with the aid of special machinery; but there are
enough kinds that can be made with utensils
found in the ordinary kitchen (with a few more
added) to make all the variety that one may wish
for. By making our own candies in the home we
have the assurance that they are at least pure and
clean, and that they will cost us no more than the
cheaper grades of candy. Candy-making is very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
fascinating, and there is no reason whatever why
one cannot be a successful candy-maker after a
few trials at it. In this first chapter we give a few
general directions in candy-making that will make
it easier to carry out all the recipes that follow.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Utensils</span></h3>

<p>All the utensils that are needed in candy-making
are saucepans of granite or porcelain, a double
boiler, spoons, a spatula, candy dipper, platter or
marble slab, a thermometer, and boxes or pans
in which to mold certain kinds of candies. Bonbon
molds are useful for molding bonbons, but
are not necessary as they can easily be molded
with the fingers. A thermometer is not absolutely
necessary since one can learn to get the different
stages by dropping and testing the syrup
in cold water; but the thermometer makes it
much easier to get the syrup cooked to exactly
the right degree. In buying a thermometer
choose one that is guaranteed by its maker, since
some thermometers are apt to break when the
syrup is boiled to a high degree as it must be in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
making the hard candies. There are small, reliable
candy thermometers on the market that do
not cost a great deal, and make it much easier for
the candy-maker.</p>

<p>While a platter can be used instead of a marble
slab in making fondant and some other candies,
yet, since the marble is naturally cool, the candy
syrups will cool much more quickly on it and for
this reason is desirable.</p>

<p>In making taffies or any candy that requires
pulling a hook is very useful. One can handle
more at a time with a hook and pulling makes it
lighter and nicer.</p>

<p>A sugar scraper proves very useful when it
comes to scraping down maple sugar and chocolate;
and a food chopper is very convenient when
chopping nuts and fruits used in candy-making.</p>

<p>A smooth piece of tin can be used for dropping
or placing the candies on, after they are made to
set and cool; but paraffine paper will take its place
very well. One can scarcely get along without
this paper in candy-making, for it is very useful
in lining candy-boxes when they are to be used as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
molds, and candies or bonbons that are liable to
become sticky can be wrapped in it. A few bowls
for dipping purposes will be needed.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Ingredients</span></h3>

<p>Granulated sugar is the kind most frequently
used in candy-making. To get the best results it
should be fine-grained and of the best quality.
Confectioner's sugar or powdered sugar is used
chiefly to roll or dust candies with.</p>

<p>Almost all confectioners use glucose in their
candies, since it helps to keep the sugar from
granulating, but, since corn syrup is composed
largely of glucose it is advisable for the home
candy-maker to use it as it can be readily obtained
at the grocery store. A few recipes call for glycerine,
and this is quite harmless, and helps to make
the candy smooth and creamy. Cream of tartar,
vinegar and lemon juice are used to prevent the
sugar from graining also.</p>

<p>The butter used in making butter-scotch, fudges
and such like candies should be of the very best
quality. Never under any circumstances use in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
candy, stale butter, or substitutes, or butter that
is very salty.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">A Few Things the Candy-Maker Should
Know</span></h3>

<p>The tests in cold water compared to degrees on
the thermometer are as follows:</p>



<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="temperatures">
<tr><td align="left">230 to 235</td><td align="left">degrees</td><td align="left">Thread stage.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">238 to 240</td><td align="center">"</td><td align="left">Soft ball stage.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">250 to 255</td><td align="center">"</td><td align="left">Hard ball stage.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">280 to 290</td><td align="center">"</td><td align="left">Crack stage.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">300 to 310</td><td align="center">"</td><td align="left">Hard crack stage.</td></tr>
</table></div>


<p>In testing the syrup with the thermometer
allow the thermometer to become hot gradually.</p>

<p>If one does not have a thermometer and has to
test the syrup in cold water one will have to depend
a great deal on sight and touch. The thread
stage is found by letting a little syrup drop from
a spoon; if it forms a thread then it is known as
the thread stage. The soft ball stage is reached
when the syrup forms a soft ball between the
fingers when dropped in cold water, and the hard
ball stage is reached when it makes a firm ball<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
between the fingers when dropped in cold water.
The crack stage is reached when it cracks or becomes
brittle, and the hard crack stage is reached
when all the water has evaporated and the syrup
is about ready to burn. At this stage one must
watch it very closely.</p>

<p>After the sugar has melted when put over the
fire, wipe the sides of the kettle down carefully;
this removes the undissolved sugar, which is apt to
cause the rest to grain if not removed.</p>

<p>All scum should be carefully removed as soon
as the syrup boils; but be careful not to stir the
syrup or jar it any more than possible. Candies
in which milk, cream or chocolate is used should
be boiled in a deep vessel as they have a tendency
to boil over. Sugar and water and corn syrup
will not boil over, so that the depth of the vessel
in which they are boiled does not matter so much.</p>

<p>Hard candies should be loosened up from the
tin, or whatever they are molded in, before they
are quite cool, or they will stick and be hard to
remove. It is well to remember that nearly all
hard candies will become sticky in warm weather,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
so should be kept in glass jars or wrapped in
waxed paper.</p>

<p>If a batch of candy should become grainy and
go back to sugar again it can be boiled over, adding
a little more water and corn syrup or cream
of tartar; but do not use the same vessel unless it
has been well washed.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Coloring and Flavoring</span></h3>

<p>Use nothing but fruit or vegetable colorings for
candy; these can usually be obtained at a drug
store, or from the confectioner. A little of these
will go a long way. Colorings can be obtained
in liquid form or in form of paste. The useful
colors are orange, yellow, red, leaf green and
violet. With red one can get all the shades of
pink, and rose. Different shades of green can be
made with the green by the amount used. Always
remember that high colors are not desirable in
candy and confine yourself to the paler shades as
much as possible. You can obtain different shades
by combining two colors; for instance, put a drop
or two of red with your violet and you will have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
another shade, and so on. A good shade can be
made with strong coffee.</p>

<p>By using different flavoring extracts one may
have a great variety in candy. Use only pure
extracts or oils. When using oil of peppermint or
oil of cinnamon for flavoring remember it is very
strong and use only a few drops, while from a
half teaspoonful to a tablespoonful of extract may
be used, according to the strength of flavoring
desired. Always add the flavoring after the
syrup has been removed from the fire, as in most
cases it will boil out if put in with the other
ingredients.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE MAKING OF FONDANT</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> foundation for innumerable cream candies
and for nearly all bonbons is what the confectioners
call "fondant." This is quite easily made
by the home candy-maker after once getting the
knack of it; but one must be careful to follow
directions closely and not become careless. It has
a great advantage from the fact that it can be
made up a long time before it is worked into
candies, since it will keep for a great length of
time. It can be made up in large quantities, but
it is best for the amateur candy-maker at first to
make it in small quantities at a time, and make it
oftener; then as she becomes more adept she may
use several pounds of sugar at a making.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fondant</span></h3>

<p>To make the fondant take two pounds of granulated
sugar, one-half cupful of water and one-fourth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
teaspoonful of cream of tartar. Boil this
to the soft ball stage or to 238 degrees. Stir the
sugar over a slow fire until it is thoroughly dissolved;
then take a damp cloth and wipe away
all the sugar crystals that appear on the sides of
the pan. When it is done remove from fire and
pour over a large platter that has been cooled or
over a marble slab. Do not scrape the contents
out of pan or allow it to drip, but pour out quickly,
then there will be less danger of its graining.
Let stand until nearly cool (not cold), then stir
until it becomes thick and creamy, working it
away from the edges of the platter or slab into
a mass in the center. Use a wooden spoon in
creaming the fondant, and it is a good idea to
sprinkle a little cold water over the top of the
syrup after it has been poured out on the platter;
this will prevent a crust from forming on top.
When too stiff to work with spoon take it in the
hands and knead until it is smooth and velvety.
Let stand a few hours until it has mellowed
somewhat, then pack down in jars and bowls,
and cover with a damp cloth. If kept for some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
time dampen the cloth occasionally. As we
said before this fondant will keep for a long time,
and one may use it when desired. If a batch
should turn grainy after stirring it can be boiled
over again, or used in making some other candy,
but in either case it must be boiled over again and
a little more water added. In making fondant it
is best to take a kettle that has not been used for
other purposes, or it will give the fondant a taste;
also be very careful to have the thermometer clean
if one is used. The fondant can be colored and
flavored when still warm, or it can be colored and
flavored when you warm or melt it when ready
to make the bonbons. Fondant should cool
quickly after it has been poured out on a platter
or slab. As marble is naturally cool it is best for
this purpose, but a platter may be placed on ice, or
dipped in cold water before being used.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chocolate Fondant</span></h3>

<p>The above directions are for white fondant,
which is the kind most generally made, but one
can make chocolate and maple fondant. To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
make the chocolate fondant take two cupfuls of
sugar and four ounces of grated chocolate and
one-half cupful of water. Boil to the soft ball
stage, flavor with a teaspoonful of vanilla and
proceed as when making white fondant. It is
best not to add the chocolate until the syrup has
boiled a while, then it can be melted and slowly
added, for the syrup must not be stirred while
boiling.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Maple Fondant</span></h3>

<p>To make maple fondant take one cupful of
brown sugar and two cupfuls of maple syrup, or
one cupful of maple sugar. If the sugar is used
add one-half cupful of water. To keep the syrup
from graining add one-fourth teaspoonful of
cream of tartar. Boil to the soft ball stage or to
238 degrees by the thermometer, and then pour
out on platter or slab, and proceed as with the
white fondant. A good substitute for maple
fondant may be made by flavoring with mapleine
some of the white fondant. Maple fondant is
especially good combined with nuts in making bonbons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
and also makes nice centers for chocolate
creams.</p>

<p>In the chapter on <a href="#Page_101">bonbons</a> you will find many
ways in which the fondant can be used, and many
other ways will no doubt suggest themselves to
you when you once begin to work with it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>HARD CANDIES</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Many</span> persons prefer the hard candies to the
soft varieties. Most of these hard candies are
boiled to the crack stage or hard crack stage,
which is from 280 to 310 degrees. In testing
these candies in cold water it is always advisable
to remove from the fire while doing so, for when
the syrup gets to the turning stage it will burn
very soon if not watched. Other hard candies
will be found classified under the chapter on <a href="#Page_61">nut
candies</a>, such as peanut brittle, nut nougats, etc.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chocolate Chips</span></h3>

<p>Place in a saucepan one cupful of brown sugar,
one-half cupful of New Orleans molasses (the
light colored molasses), and one tablespoonful of
butter. Boil to the crack stage, then remove from
the fire and flavor with one teaspoonful of vanilla.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Pull into long thin sheets, and cut into small
pieces. When cold dip into melted chocolate
flavored with a little vanilla.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cinnamon Jibb</span></h3>

<p>Place in a saucepan one cupful of golden
corn syrup, one-fourth cupful of butter, a tablespoonful
of cinnamon, and one-half cupful of
water. Boil to the crack stage. Pour into buttered
pans, and mark off into squares. When
cool break up.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fig Brittle</span></h3>

<p>Take two cupfuls of light brown sugar, one
cupful of golden corn syrup and one-half cupful
of water. Cook to the crack stage, and then stir
in figs that have been cut up into bits. Pour into
a buttered pan, and mark off. When cool break
up. Date brittle can be made in the same manner.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Butter-Scotch</span></h3>

<p>Take two cupfuls of light brown sugar, one-half
cupful of butter, one-fourth cupful of water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
and one tablespoonful of vinegar. Boil to the
crack stage. Pour into buttered tins, mark off
into squares, and when cool break up. A tablespoonful
or two of molasses improves butter-scotch
for many persons.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">French Butter-Scotch</span></h3>

<p>Take two cupfuls of granulated sugar, one-half
cupful of maple sugar, one-half cupful of butter,
one tablespoonful of vinegar, and one-fourth cupful
of water. Cook to the crack stage or to 280
degrees, then remove from fire and add one teaspoonful
of vanilla, and one-fourth teaspoonful
soda. Mark into strips, and when cold cut with a
pair of shears.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Maple Panocha</span></h3>

<p>Take one cupful of maple sugar, one cupful of
light brown sugar, two tablespoonfuls of butter,
and one-half cupful of water. Boil to the crack
stage. Pour over pecan meats that have been
placed on a buttered pan. When cold break in
any manner desired.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Horehound Candy</span></h3>

<p>Take two cupfuls of brown sugar, one cupful of
corn syrup, and one-half teaspoonful of cream of
tartar. Pour over this the horehound liquid made
by steeping two ounces of dried horehound (which
can be obtained at the drug store) in one pint of
hot water. Boil down to a cupful before adding
to the sugar. If you do not wish it to be very
strong of horehound don't use quite so much.
Boil to the hard crack stage or about 300 degrees.
Pour into a buttered pan or pans. Mark deeply
into small squares while still warm, and when
cool it will break easily.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chocolate Taffy</span></h3>

<p>Take two cupfuls of sugar, one cupful of golden
corn syrup, one-half cupful of boiling water, and
one-fourth teaspoonful of cream of tartar. Boil to
the soft ball stage, then add two ounces of unsweetened
chocolate shaved fine. Boil to nearly the
crack stage or about 270 degrees, then add one
teaspoonful of vanilla. Pour out on a buttered
platter, cool and pull. Cut into small pieces,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
using shears or sharp knife, and place on buttered
plate or paraffine paper.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Molasses Taffy</span></h3>

<p>Take two cupfuls of sugar, and one-half cupful of
New Orleans or baking molasses, and one-half cupful
of corn syrup, and a third teaspoonful of cream of
tartar. Boil to about the crack stage. Turn out on
a greased platter, and when cool enough pull until
light colored. Cut in small pieces.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Nut Taffy</span></h3>

<p>Take two cupfuls of light brown sugar, one-half
cupful of corn syrup, one-half cupful of water, and
one-fourth teaspoonful of cream of tartar. Boil
to the hard ball stage. Add one teaspoonful of vanilla,
and one cupful of nut meats, chopped. Pour
out on a platter, and pull as soon as cool enough.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lemon Stick Candy</span></h3>

<p>Take two cupfuls of granulated sugar, one-half
cupful of white corn syrup, one-half cupful of
water, and the juice of one lemon. Boil all together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
with half the rind of the lemon to the crisp
or crack stage. Flavor with one teaspoonful of
extract of lemon, and color with yellow coloring.
Pour out on a buttered platter, and when cool
enough pull into sticks, and cut about four inches
long.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Peppermint Stick Candy</span></h3>

<p>Make the same as the lemon stick, but omit the
lemon, and use one-fourth teaspoonful of cream of
tartar. After removing from fire flavor with
peppermint. Divide the candy into two portions,
and color one with red coloring. Pull each part
separately, then twist the red candy around the
white till you have it in form of a stick. Cut
into sticks, and if desired form into canes.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Strawberry Drops</span></h3>

<p>Take two cupfuls of granulated sugar, one-half
cupful of corn syrup, the juice of one lemon, and
a fourth cupful of water. A tablespoonful of
vinegar can be used instead of lemon juice if desired.
Boil to the hard crack stage. Color with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
red coloring and flavor with strawberry flavoring.
Drop from a spoon in drops about the size of a
nickel onto waxed or greased paper. By flavoring
with different flavoring and using different
colorings you may have a variety in these drop
candies.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Honey Peppermint Tablets</span></h3>

<p>Take one cupful of honey, one cupful of sugar
and one-half cupful of white corn syrup, one-fourth
teaspoonful of cream of tartar and one teaspoonful
of butter. Boil to the crack stage, then
remove from fire and add one teaspoonful of
peppermint extract. Drop from a spoon onto
oiled paper, about the size of a nickel or quarter.
This candy can be pulled if preferred, and cut into
pieces.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Maple Tablets</span></h3>

<p>Melt together in a saucepan one cupful of maple
sugar and one cupful of light brown sugar, four
tablespoonfuls of butter, one teaspoonful of lemon
juice and one tablespoonful of water. Boil to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
hard crack stage, and drop on oiled paper in
drops about the size of a nickel. When partly
cool stick two of the drops together.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fruit Tablets</span></h3>

<p>Take one cupful of sugar, one-half cupful of
corn syrup and one-half glass of currant or any
kind of jelly. Boil to the crack stage, add a
teaspoonful of vanilla, almond or the kind of
flavoring that goes best with the jelly used. Drop
from a spoon on oiled or waxed paper, and when
partly cool put two drops together.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Rose Nougat</span></h3>

<p>Take two cupfuls of granulated sugar, one-half
cupful white corn syrup, one-half cupful of water
and a fourth teaspoonful of cream of tartar. Boil
to the crack stage. Add one-half cupful of finely
chopped candied cherries, and color a rose color
with fruit or vegetable coloring. Let stand for a
few moments until partly cool, then pour over the
whites of two stiffly beaten eggs. Beat well and
pour into a buttered mold. Cut into squares.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
One-half cupful of finely chopped almonds can be
added if desired and flavored with one-half teaspoonful
of almond extract.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Raisin Stickies</span></h3>

<p>Take one cupful of sugar and one cupful of
golden corn syrup and one cupful of finely chopped
raisins, and one-half cupful of water and boil to
the crack stage. Add one-half teaspoonful of
cinnamon and one teaspoonful of vanilla. Pour
into buttered pans, and when partly cool, mark
off into sticks about an inch across. Twist each
stick until twice the original length and cut in two.
Place on paraffine paper until cool.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Vanilla Taffy</span></h3>

<p>Place in a saucepan two cupfuls of white sugar,
one cupful of white corn syrup, and one-half cupful
of water. Bring to a boil, then add one teaspoonful
of glycerine and a fourth teaspoonful of cream
of tartar. Boil to about 260 degrees or to a little
more than the hard ball stage and not quite to
the crack stage. Pour on a greased platter or a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
slab, and add a tablespoonful of vanilla. Dip
your hands in corn-starch and as soon as it cools
enough to be handled pull until it is white and
waxy. If a hook is used you can make nicer and
whiter taffy. Remove from hands or hook and
lay on waxed paper, and when cold break up; or
it can be cut into small pieces while still warm.
In summer taffy should be wrapped in waxed
paper, since it is liable to become very sticky.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Salt Water Taffy</span></h3>

<p>This is made the same as the vanilla taffy
except that a tablespoonful of butter is added
and one teaspoonful of salt. This can be flavored
and colored to suit the taste and pulled like the
vanilla taffy. In making taffy fold over the
edges as it cools and keep folding the batch up
until cool enough to pull.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Taffy Dreams with Nut Centers</span></h3>

<p>Place in a saucepan two pounds of granulated
sugar, one cup of water and one-half teaspoonful
cream of tartar or a tablespoonful of lemon juice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
Boil to the hard ball stage. Place some nut
meats in a bowl and pour enough of the syrup
over these so that they will be well coated. Set
these in a cool place while pulling the remainder
of the taffy. Put the syrup over the fire and boil
until nearly the crack stage, then remove and
flavor with vanilla or almond, or any flavoring
desired. Pour over a large platter or a marble
slab. Cool quickly, and then dip your hands in
corn-starch and pull the candy until white. Form
into a sheet about six inches wide while still
warm. Lay on a tin or slab and spread the nut
mixture in the center. Fold the edge of sheet
over, pinch the edges together so that the nut
part cannot be seen. Now stretch the candy by
pulling it gently and quickly through the palms
of both hands. Cut into pieces with a sharp
knife and lay on waxed paper. Nut and fruit
combined can be used for the centers, or fruit
alone. In this case pour the syrup over them to
make them stick together as above.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a><br /><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a><br /><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a><br /><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>FUDGES AND CARAMELS</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Fudge</span> is one of the most easily made, and one
of the most popular of all the home-made candies.
Caramels are also a favorite. These candies can
be made a great variety of ways.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chocolate Fudge</span></h3>

<p>Take two cupfuls of sugar, two ounces of chocolate,
one cup of good milk, and one tablespoonful
of butter, or if you wish a richer fudge use two
tablespoonfuls of butter. Bring the sugar, milk
and butter to a boil and cook until it threads or
to 235 degrees. Add the chocolate which should
be melted or shaved fine. Stir it in well, then
add a teaspoonful of vanilla, and beat up until
creamy. The secret of good fudge lies in the
beating. Some stir constantly from the time it
is removed from the fire until it turns creamy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
while others let it stand until nearly cool, and
then beat up until creamy. Pour into buttered
pan or mold, and when cold cut into neat small
squares.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Maple Sugar Fudge</span></h3>

<p>Take two cups of maple sugar, one cup of milk,
one tablespoonful of butter, and one cupful of
chopped walnut meats. Boil until the mixture
forms a soft ball when dropped into cold water, or
to about 240 degrees. Remove from fire and let
stand until nearly cool, then stir until creamy.
Pour into greased pans, and when cool cut into
squares.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Burnt Almond Fudge</span></h3>

<p>Brown blanched almonds in the oven and chop
rather coarsely. Brown one-half cupful of granulated
sugar in a granite pan; then add two-thirds
cupful of milk, and when the browned sugar is
thoroughly dissolved add one cupful of granulated
sugar and one tablespoonful of butter.
Boil until it makes a firm ball when dropped in
cold water; flavor with almond extract and add<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
one cupful of the browned almonds; stir until
creamy, then pour into pans and mark off into
squares.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Coffee Fudge</span></h3>

<p>Take two cupfuls of granulated sugar, one cupful
of strong boiled coffee, one-half cupful of
cream and a teaspoonful of butter. Boil to the
soft ball stage, then add a cupful of chopped nut
meats, and stir until creamy. Pour into pans and
cut into squares. The nuts may be omitted if
desired.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Marshmallow Fudge</span></h3>

<p>Take two cupfuls of light brown sugar, a cupful
of milk, a tablespoonful of butter, and a fourth
teaspoonful of cream of tartar. Boil until it
threads or to 235 degrees, and then add a half
pound of marshmallows. Beat until dissolved,
add a cupful of chopped walnut meats. Pour
into buttered pans and cut into squares. Another
way to make this fudge is to omit the nuts and
add two squares of chocolate.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Peanut Fudge</span></h3>

<p>Take two cupfuls of brown sugar, one cupful of
milk, and one teaspoonful of butter. When oily
nuts are used in fudge one does not need to use so
much butter. Boil to the thread or soft ball
stage, and then add one cupful of finely ground
peanuts and one teaspoonful vanilla. If preferred
peanut butter may be used. Beat up until creamy,
pour into buttered pans, and cut into squares.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fig Fudge</span></h3>

<p>Take two cupfuls of granulated sugar, one cupful
of water, a fourth teaspoonful of cream of
tartar, one-half pound of figs, one teaspoonful of
ginger, and one tablespoonful of butter. Boil the

fire and beat up until creamy. Pour into a buttered
pan and mark into squares. Chop the figs
before adding.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Divinity Fudge</span></h3>

<p>Take two cupfuls of light brown sugar, add
one-half cupful of golden corn syrup, and one-half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
cupful of water. Boil to the hard ball stage.
Add one cupful of chopped walnut meats, and one

<p>Take two cupfuls of granulated sugar, one cupful
of milk, one tablespoonful of butter, and one-fourth

of grated cocoanut. Beat up until quite creamy.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fruit Fudge</span></h3>

<p>Take two cupfuls of light brown sugar, a cupful
of milk, a tablespoonful of butter, and a pinch of
cream of tartar. Boil until it makes a soft ball,

of water, and a pinch of cream of tartar.
Boil to the hard ball stage, then add one cupful
of candied pineapple. Pour over the stiffly beaten
whites of two eggs, and beat up until light and
foamy.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Layer Fudges</span></h3>

<p>These are fine and are made by pouring one
kind of fudge upon another in layers. For this
purpose one should use only the fudges that combine
well together. Layers of several different
kinds of fudge may be used, or only two, as desired.
A chocolate fudge with a layer of divinity fudge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
between is delicious. Pour half of the chocolate
fudge into a pan, and when cool pour over it a
layer of divinity fudge; then when this has
cooled pour over the remainder of the chocolate
fudge which should have been kept hot in a bowl
set in hot water. Fruit and nut fudges make a
good combination.</p>

marshmallows. Let stand a while until
soft; then pour the mixture over the stiffly beaten
whites of two eggs. Beat up until it begins to get
creamy, then pour into buttered pans, and when
cool cut into squares.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Barley Fudge</span></h3>

<p>Take a cupful of barley and brown it in the
oven; be careful not to burn it, but have it a
nice brown. Run this through the coffee-grinder.
Take two cupfuls of brown sugar, one-half cupful
of corn syrup, one-half cupful of milk and a

then add one-fourth pound of chocolate. Continue
to boil to the hard ball stage or about 250 degrees.
Flavor with vanilla, and pour into a buttered pan
about an inch thick. Mark off into squares while
still warm.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sultana Caramels</span></h3>

<p>Put into a saucepan two cupfuls of light brown
sugar, one cupful of golden corn syrup, one-half
cupful of milk and one-fourth cupful of butter.
Bring to the boiling point, then add a cupful of Sultana

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>NUT CANDIES</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Many</span> delicious candies may be made by adding
nuts to the other ingredients, and since nuts have
much food value these candies are healthful and
nourishing.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chocolate Almonds</span></h3>

<p>Blanch a pound of almonds; this is done by
pouring hot water over the almond meats and
letting them stand on back of stove for about five
minutes when the skins can easily be slipped off.
Place on a pan in the oven and brown a nice dark
brown, but be careful not to let them burn.
When cool dip each almond in melted sweet
chocolate.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Brown Almond Nougat</span></h3>

<p>Blanch and cut one pound of sweet almonds in
slices; lay them on a paper in a pan, and place in
the oven until slightly brown. Take two cupfuls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
of granulated sugar, one-half cupful of golden
corn syrup, and one teaspoonful of lemon juice.
Melt to a liquid, stirring well, then add the almonds
and mix well with the syrup. Butter a
large platter or marble slab. Pour the nougat on
this and make it even with a lemon, which should
be lightly dipped in oil or melted butter. Make
it about an inch thick, and cut into strips or bars,
or it may be used to line molds. The molds are
first slightly buttered on the inside, then a thin
layer of nougat is pressed against the form; this
must be done while the nougat is still warm.
When cool turn out of form or mold, and these
may then be filled with candied fruit and whipped
cream, candies or ice-cream.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">White Nougat</span></h3>

<p>Boil two pounds of honey to the crack stage,
or nearly to the crack, have the whites of four
eggs beaten stiff, and add to the honey. Stir
over a slow fire until it has reached the crack
stage; then add two pounds of blanched almonds
cut into strips and slightly browned in the oven.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
Mix all together and pour on platter or marble
slab, or else line a nougat frame with wafer paper
which can be bought at a confectionery shop, then
pour the nougat into the frame, put board and
weight on top.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Peanut Brittle</span></h3>

<p>Take two cupfuls of light brown sugar, one
cup of corn syrup, one-half cupful of water, one
tablespoonful of butter and cook to the crack stage,
then add a teaspoonful of vanilla, and two cupfuls
of peanuts that have been slightly roasted, and
stir until it begins to turn brown. Be careful not
to let it burn, or become more than a golden
brown in color. Add one tablespoonful (level) of
soda, stirring it quickly, then pour over a greased
platter or marble slab. As soon as it is thin
enough to handle, loosen from the platter or slab
with a knife, turn over and stretch out very thin.
Break up into any desired shape when cold.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Almond Toffee</span></h3>

<p>Take two cupfuls of brown sugar, two tablespoonfuls
of butter and one-half cupful of cream<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>

of chopped almonds and one teaspoonful of
vanilla. Boil to the crack stage. Pour into buttered
pans, and mark off into squares.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Southern Hazelnut Toffee</span></h3>

<p>Melt one-half cupful of butter in a saucepan, add
one cupful brown sugar and one cupful New Orleans
molasses. Boil to the hard ball stage, add
one cupful of chopped hazelnuts and boil to the
crack stage. Pour into buttered pan, and mark
off into squares.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mexican Panocha</span></h3>

<p>Take two cupfuls of brown sugar, one-half cupful
of corn syrup, one cupful of sweet milk, one
teaspoonful of butter, and one square of chocolate.
Mix the ingredients and boil to the hard
ball stage, stirring the mixture constantly while
on the stove. Add one cupful of pecan or any
chopped nut meats, and pour into buttered pans.
When cold cut into squares.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Pralines</span></h3>

<p>Take two cupfuls of light brown sugar, one
cupful of cream, and boil to the soft ball stage.
Remove from fire and add one cupful of whole
pecan meats, and one teaspoonful of vanilla. Stir
until creamy, but be careful not to break the nut
meats. A good way is to stir until it begins to
cream, then add the nuts, and stir until the meats
are well mixed with the creamy mass. Place in a
cool place for a while, then separate the nut
meats, keeping each one roughly coated with the
cream candy.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cream Nut Bars</span></h3>

<p>Take two cupfuls of light brown sugar, one
cupful of maple sugar, and one cupful of cream
and boil to the soft ball stage. Remove from the
fire and stir in one teaspoonful of vanilla, then stir
until it begins to get creamy; add one cupful of
finely chopped nut meats. Pour into a square pan,
mark off into small squares, and press a half nut
meat in center of each square. Cut into bars
when cool, allowing two or three squares to a bar.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Maple and Butternut Cream</span></h3>

<p>Take two cupfuls of maple sugar, and one cup
of cream. Boil to the soft ball stage. Remove
from the fire and add one cupful butternut meats,
and stir until it turns creamy. Pour into buttered
pans, and cut into squares. Maple and walnut
creams may be made in the same manner. Place
a half of a nut meat on top of each square.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chocolate Nut Candy</span></h3>

<p>Take two cupfuls of granulated sugar, one-half
cupful of water, one-fourth teaspoonful of cream of
tartar, and boil to the soft ball stage, then add
one-fourth cupful of melted chocolate, one teaspoonful
of vanilla and one cupful of nut meats.
Beat up until creamy. Pour into buttered pans,
and when cold cut into squares or bars. Peanuts,
walnuts, pecans or any kind of nuts can be used
for this candy.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Nut Bonbons</span></h3>

<p>Take two cupfuls of granulated sugar, one-half
cupful of white corn syrup, one-fourth teaspoonful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
of cream of tartar. Boil to the soft ball stage.
Pour into four different plates. In one plate put
a little melted chocolate and a fourth teaspoonful
of vanilla, on another plate pour a few drops of red
coloring and flavor with strawberry, on another
plate pour a little yellow coloring and flavor with
orange or lemon. Drop about a dozen almonds on
each plate, the fourth plate being left white.
Stir each plate until syrup is creamy, and each
nut is well coated with the sugar. Separate each
nut and place on waxed paper.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Candied Chestnuts</span></h3>

<p>Take the chestnuts that are to be candied and
score each nut on one side with a sharp knife.
Cover with boiling water, cook five minutes and
dry. Add a teaspoonful of butter to each pint of
nuts, and stir or shake over the fire for five
minutes. This loosens the shells and the inner
skins, which can now be removed together. Cover
the shelled nuts with cold water, and to each
pound of nuts add the juice of one lemon. Let
stand in this over night, since this will help to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
harden the nuts, so they can be boiled without
breaking up. In the morning, drain, and simmer
slowly for one or two hours, or until the nuts are
tender. Make a syrup using a pound of sugar to
each pound of nuts. Add to each two cupfuls of
sugar a half cupful of water and cook until thick,
add the nuts and simmer slowly for a half hour,
then drain; let them stand in the syrup over night,
removing them from the fire. The next day boil
the syrup until thick as honey.</p>

<p>Remove the nuts and place on plates and set in
the oven or in the sun to dry. Boil the syrup
down a little thicker, and pour over the nuts
several times while drying until all is absorbed.
Dry the nuts and store between layers of waxed
paper in a box.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Glacé Nuts</span></h3>

<p>Take two cupfuls of granulated sugar, one-half
cupful of water, and one-half teaspoonful of cream
of tartar. Boil to the hard crack stage or until
the syrup begins to turn brown. Add a teaspoonful
of vanilla. Take the nuts to be dipped separately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
on a long pin, dip into the syrup to cover,
remove and place on oiled or waxed paper. Almonds,
walnuts, hazelnuts, pecans and peanuts can
be used for dipping.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Walnut Bonbons</span></h3>

<p>Place in a saucepan one cupful of granulated
sugar, one-half cupful of golden corn syrup, one-half
cupful of water, and a pinch of cream of
tartar. Boil to the hard ball stage, then add
one-half teaspoonful of vanilla and one-half cupful
of English walnut meats chopped fine. Pour
over the beaten white of one egg, and beat up
until light. When it begins to harden drop on
halved English walnut meats and press a half nut
meat on the top of each bonbon.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Peanut Molasses Candy</span></h3>

<p>Take one cupful of sugar, one cupful of New
Orleans or sorghum molasses, and a tablespoonful of
butter and boil to the hard crack stage. Stir in two
cupfuls of peanuts, or just as many as you can,
as the more nuts in this candy the better. Pour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
on a greased pan. When cold break into pieces
or cut into squares with a very sharp knife.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mexican Nut Confection</span></h3>

<p>Take two cupfuls of light brown sugar, a quart
of sweet milk and boil until the sugar is all melted,
then stir in the well beaten yolks of six eggs.
Boil until thick and smooth, stirring constantly,
then add one pound of almonds that have been
blanched and worked into a paste, and one teaspoonful
of cinnamon. Boil to a firm mass, and
stir to keep from sticking. This should be made
in a double boiler. Pour into a buttered mold at
least two inches thick, and when very cold slice.
This is good dipped in chocolate or fondant.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Nut Loaf</span></h3>

<p>Take an equal quantity of walnut, hickory-nut,
almond and pecan meats and chop fine. To each
cupful of nut meats have one-half cupful of
chopped fruit, using dates, figs, raisins or candied
cherries. Work the fruit and nuts well together.
For each cupful of this mixture take one cupful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
of fondant. Melt the fondant, and stir the fruit
and nut mixture into it; then remove and knead.
Form this into an oblong loaf, flatten on top.
Cover with paraffine paper and let stand for several
days until the fruit and nuts are well blended
with the fondant, then cut into slices.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Nut Stuffed Fruit</span></h3>

<p>Dates are especially nice stuffed with nut meats.
Remove the stones and insert a salted blanched
almond in each, or chop up some walnut meats
and work into a paste with a little cream or
fondant and insert in the center of the dates.
Close up and roll the dates in powdered sugar
or else dip into fondant. Large prunes soaked
over night until plump, and then stuffed with
chopped almonds or pecan nut meats are fine.
Large Sultana raisins are also good stuffed with
nut meats.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cherry and Almond Confection</span></h3>

<p>Take two cupfuls of sugar, one-half cupful of
corn syrup and a half cupful of milk and boil to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
the soft ball stage. Add a half cupful of chopped
almonds, one-half cupful of candied cherries, and
one teaspoonful almond extract. Stir until
creamy, pour into buttered pan, and when cold
cut into squares. Decorate some of the squares
with almond meats and others with candied cherries.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>FRUIT CANDIES</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> of the most delicious home-made candies
are made with the addition of fruits to the other
ingredients. All kinds of candied fruits, also
many kinds of dried fruits, such as dates, figs,
raisins and prunes may be used in candy-making.
Many may not know that just as delicious candies
can be made with our home-preserved fruits.</p>

<p>Candied fruits are in most cases expensive, but
they can be made at home, and therefore the expense
cut down. Cherries can be candied in the
following manner: Select nice, large, and not
over-ripe cherries for this purpose. Stone them
carefully. Weigh the cherries, and to each pound
of the fruit add two pounds of sugar, using only
the best granulated for this purpose. Put the
sugar in a kettle with one-half cupful of water,
and boil to a thick syrup, removing all scum as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
arises. Place a few of the cherries in at a time,
and let simmer slowly until the fruit is transparent.
Remove the fruit with a strainer, and add
more of them until all have been cooked in this
manner. Then place them back in syrup and let
them stand over night in it. In the morning remove
and place them out in the sun. It is a good
idea to place them in a sieve, spreading them over
it, and then cover the sieve with netting. They
can be dried in the oven if desired, but one must
be careful that they do not burn. When dried
place in boxes between layers of paraffine paper,
sprinkling each layer with powdered sugar.
Place in a dry place until ready to use them
in making candies. Pears, quinces, pineapples,
peaches and plums may all be candied. Select
firm-textured fruit and boil until tender in water
before placing in the syrup; then proceed as in
candying the cherries. Orange and lemon rind
may also be candied. Remove the skin from the
oranges or lemons in quarters and simmer in
water until soft; then drain and remove all the
white portion by scraping with a silver knife or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
spoon. Cut the oranges or lemons into small
strips with the scissors, cook in the thick syrup,
and roll in granulated sugar.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Quince Confections</span></h3>

<p>Melt some fondant in a bowl, flavor with orange
or lemon. Put some preserved quinces into the
oven until dry. Dip each quarter into melted
fondant. Place on oiled paper to dry. Preserved
pineapple can be used in the same way.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Maraschino Drops</span></h3>

<p>Take maraschino cherries. Dip into melted
white or pink fondant that has been flavored with
almond extract; then when hardened dip into
melted chocolate fondant, or melted chocolate.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Strawberry Divinity Fudge</span></h3>

<p>Place in a saucepan two cupfuls of granulated
sugar, half a cupful of water and a fourth teaspoonful
of cream of tartar. Boil to the hard ball
stage. Add one glassful of whole preserved
strawberries and boil up again. Pour the mixture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
over the stiffly beaten whites of two eggs and
beat up until light and foamy. When the mixture
begins to harden pour into buttered pans and
when cool cut into squares. Any thick preserved
fruits can be used in the same way. Preserved
strawberries and preserved pineapple are good
combined, half and half of each being used. If
pear preserves are used a little chopped ginger
will be an improvement.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Tutti-Frutti Cream</span></h3>

<p>Melt one pound of fondant in a double-boiler,
add one teaspoonful of vanilla or orange flavor;
then add one tablespoonful of strawberry preserves
(using only the berries), one tablespoonful
of preserved cherries, two tablespoonfuls of preserved
or candied pineapple, and one tablespoonful
each of peach and pear preserves. The addition
also of a teaspoonful each of candied orange
and lemon peel will improve the mixture. When
partly cool pour into a mold for slicing or form
into bonbon shapes. If not quite stiff enough add
powdered sugar to make of the right consistency<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
to mold nicely. These can be rolled in powdered
sugar or dipped in colored melted fondant or
coated with chocolate.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Pear Caramels</span></h3>

<p>Place in a saucepan two cupfuls of light brown
sugar, one cupful of corn syrup, half a cupful of
good milk and one tablespoonful of butter. Boil
for a few minutes, then add one cupful of preserved
pears, half a cupful of chopped candied
ginger and a fourth cupful of candied lemon
peel. Boil to the hard ball stage, add one teaspoonful
of orange flavor and pour into pans.
When cold cut into squares. Peach caramels are
made in the same manner, only instead of the
candied ginger a cupful of chopped almonds is
added, the orange or lemon peel is omitted and
almond extract used.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Marzipan Fruit Candies</span></h3>

<p>Delicious fruit candies can be made by using
marzipan paste. To make this paste take one cup
of blanched almonds and run them through a food<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
chopper; then pound to a fine flour. Place in a
bowl and add to this flour the same amount of
powdered sugar. Use enough water, rose water,
orange juice or grape juice to make stiff paste&mdash;about
three ounces will be enough. Beat an egg
up stiff and work it into the paste. Roll out the
marzipan an inch thick and cut into rounds or
squares. Place a bit of preserved fruit on each
one and mold the paste up around it. Place in
the oven until the candies are dry. Another way
to make the paste is to boil the ingredients. Use
about three ounces of rose water or other liquid
to the amount of almonds and sugar given above.
Stir over a slow fire until when touched with the
finger the syrup will cling. When cool knead
into a paste.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Surprise Dates</span></h3>

<p>Select some nice large dates and remove the
stones. Fill some of the cavities with chopped
raisins, figs, nuts and so forth, and some with
chopped candied cherries; try to have the
varieties of fillings as great as possible. Fondant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
with several different flavorings may also be used.
Dip some of these stuffed dates in chocolate
fondant, some in different colored fondants and
some in plain white. Every date eaten then will
prove to be a surprise and delight.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Marshmallow Fruit Fudge</span></h3>

<p>Tear out a piece from the center of each marshmallow,
being careful not to make a hole quite
through it. Fill the cavities thus formed with
any good preserved fruit. Make a chocolate
fudge and pour it over the marshmallows, which
should have been placed on greased paper in a
pan. Be sure that the fruit is entirely covered.
When cold cut out in cakes; they can be dipped
in chocolate or left as they are. These are delicious
and will prove an agreeable surprise to
those who have never eaten them before.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Frosted Fruit Fudge</span></h3>

<p>Make a good chocolate fudge, beating it until
creamy, and pour it into a greased pan to about
an inch in depth. When this is almost hard cover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
with any thick preserved fruit desired. Then
place in a kettle one cup of granulated sugar, a
fourth cupful of water and a pinch of cream of
tartar. When the mixture has boiled to the hard
ball stage pour it over the stiffly beaten white of
one egg, add a teaspoonful of vanilla, or the kind
of flavoring that will combine best with the fruit
used, and beat up until light and foamy. Pour
this over the fruit in the pan. When cold cut
into squares, and you will have a delicious candy.
Nut meats can be mixed in with the fruit. Almonds
are also very good combined with peach
preserves.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cherry Foam</span></h3>

<p>Place in a saucepan two cupfuls of granulated
sugar, half a cupful of water and a fourth teaspoonful
of cream of tartar. Boil until it forms a
hard ball. Just before taking the syrup from the
fire stir in a cupful of preserved cherries&mdash;the
clear, transparent kinds are best. Pour the mixture
over the stiffly beaten whites of two eggs
and beat until light and foamy. Lay whole candied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
cherries two inches apart on waxed or greased
paper and drop the foam by spoonfuls on these,
pressing candied cherries on top of each. This
candy is not only delicious but pretty to the eye
as well.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fig Favorites</span></h3>

<p>Select the best quality of figs and steam until
soft, then make an incision in each lengthwise and
stuff with chopped nut meats. Close and place
on a buttered pan. Boil together two cupfuls of
sugar, one-half cupful of water, and one-fourth
teaspoonful of cream of tartar. Boil until it
will make a hard ball when dropped into cold
water, flavor with a little vanilla, and then pour
over the stuffed figs. When nearly cold mark off
into squares, then dip in melted chocolate.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Pineapple Marshmallows</span></h3>

<p>Soak four ounces of gum arabic in one cupful
of pineapple juice until dissolved; then strain
through cheese-cloth. Put into a saucepan with
one-half pound of best powdered sugar and place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
saucepan in a pan of hot water on the stove. Stir
the mixture until it becomes thick and white.
Drop a little into cold water, and if it becomes a
firm ball, remove from the fire and whip into it
the stiffly beaten whites of three eggs. Flavor
with a teaspoonful of vanilla. Dust a square pan
with corn-starch and pour in the mixture until an
inch thick. Let it stand in a cool place for twelve
hours, then cut it into inch squares and roll in a
mixture of powdered sugar and corn-starch.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fruit Chocolate Balls</span></h3>

<p>Take one cupful each of dates, seeded raisins
and English walnut meats. Pass through a food
chopper. Form into balls, and dip into melted
chocolate fondant.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Watermelon Dainty</span></h3>

<p>Take two cupfuls of sugar, one-fourth cupful of
water, one tablespoonful of white corn syrup, and
a pinch of cream of tartar and boil until it spins
a thread or to 230 degrees. Pour over the stiffly
beaten whites of two eggs, and beat up until light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
and foamy. Add one teaspoonful of vanilla, one
cupful of chopped preserved watermelon rind, and
one-half cupful of chopped nut meats. Color pink
with a little red fruit or vegetable coloring. Pour
into a buttered pan or mold to cool and cut into
squares.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Date Delight</span></h3>

<p>Take two cupfuls of light brown sugar, one
cupful of milk, and one tablespoonful of butter.
Boil to the soft ball stage. Add a teaspoonful of
vanilla, and one cupful of chopped dates. Beat
up until creamy. Pour into buttered pan or mold,
and cut into squares when cold.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stuffed Prunes</span></h3>

<p>Remove the stones from the prunes. Crack the
stones and chop up the pits. Add the chopped
pits to chopped dates, and fill the cavities of the
prunes with the mixture. Dip the prunes in
melted fondant. Another way to stuff the prunes
is to stone some dates, fit a cherry inside of each
date, then fit the date into the prune, and dip in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
the fondant. The prunes should be soaked in
water for several hours before stuffing, and should
be drained and wiped dry. Prunes filled with
fondant or fondant and nuts mixed are also delicious.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fruit Roll</span></h3>

<p>Cook two cupfuls of brown sugar, one-half cupful
of golden corn syrup and one-fourth cupful of
water until it spins a thread. Remove from the
fire and add the grated rind of one lemon and
one orange, and a teaspoonful of the juice of each,
one cupful of seeded raisins, one cupful of English
currants, one-half cupful of cocoanut, one-half cupful
of dates, and one-fourth cupful of figs; these
fruits should all be run through a food chopper.
Stir all until it forms a mass. Roll out into a
thin sheet, and then roll up like a jelly roll, and cut
into thin slices.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Jelly Cake Candy</span></h3>

<p>Melt some fondant and pour into a square or
round mold. Candy boxes lined with waxed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
paper will do. When cool place over this a thin
layer of some thick jelly, such as currant, red
raspberry, or orange; then pour over this another
layer of fondant, and when this has cooled spread
with another thin layer of jelly and pour over the
top some more fondant. The layers of fondant
may be colored differently if desired, and flavored
to suit the jelly used. When cold turn out
of mold, and cut into thin slices.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>SEA FOAM AND CREAM CANDIES</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Sea foam</span> and cream candies are delicious, and
very easily made by the home candy-maker. Sea
foam candies are those in which the white of egg
is used, while the cream candies are made much
after the same manner as fondant is made, except
that cream is used instead of water.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Ginger Creams</span></h3>

<p>Place in a saucepan two cupfuls of granulated
sugar, one-half cupful of cream, one-fourth teaspoonful
of cream of tartar or a few drops of acetic

water or to about 240 degrees; then pour the
syrup on a large platter and when it has become
slightly cool cover with candied ginger cut into
thin strips&mdash;about one-half cupful will be enough.
Work with a wooden spoon from the sides of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
dish until it becomes creamy and smooth; then

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>BONBONS</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> foundation for nearly all bonbons is fondant.
Hundreds of varieties of bonbons can be
made by using different flavorings and different
combinations of one kind with another. Bonbon
making is fascinating work, and after they are
made the home candy-maker has the satisfaction
of knowing that she has a pure delicious candy at
much less expense than if she bought it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chocolate Creams</span></h3>

<p>Many may be surprised to know that they can
make several hundred different varieties of chocolate
creams alone. The simplest chocolate creams
are made by dipping the plain fondant, after it
has been formed in bonbon shapes, into melted
chocolate. These fondant centers may be flavored
with vanilla, peppermint, wintergreen, pineapple,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
orange, lemon, banana, almond, pistachio, cinnamon,
allspice and clove, rose and other kinds of
flavors found in the market. Certain kinds of
flavors can also be combined, which helps to add
to the variety. Maple chocolate creams are made
by dipping maple fondant into melted chocolate.
Plain fondant, chocolate fondant and maple fondant
are all fine combined with nuts. All sorts of
candied fruits, preserved fruits and dried fruits
are delicious combined with fondant in making
these creams. Candied peels and candied ginger
are also much used.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chocolate Creams With Fruit Centers</span></h3>

<p>Maraschino cherries, drained and dipped first
in melted fondant flavored with almond, and then
coated with chocolate, are delicious.</p>

<p>Bits of candied pineapple dipped into fondant
flavored with pineapple, lemon or orange and then
coated with the chocolate, are fine.</p>

<p>Work some thick pear preserves into fondant,
add a little chopped candied ginger, and when
cool coat with chocolate. Or before coating them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
with chocolate dip in fondant flavored with lemon
or vanilla.</p>

<p>Peach preserves dried in the oven, cooled and
dipped in almond flavored fondant, then coated
with chocolate, is another good combination.</p>

<p>Whole strawberry preserves, drained of all
juice, rolled in powdered sugar, then coated with
chocolate, are delicious.</p>

<p>Chopped candied cherries mixed into melted
fondant either flavored with vanilla or almond,
formed into bonbon shape, then coated with melted
chocolate, are fine. Some of these cherry centers
may be left white and red, or the fondant used can
be colored rose and pink with a few drops of red
fruit coloring.</p>

<p>Candied lemon rind, orange rind or citron can
be cut up into small pieces, worked into fondant,
and then coated with chocolate. Yellow fondant
flavored with orange or lemon can be used with
orange and lemon rind.</p>

<p>Stiff marmalades and jellies can be cut into
fancy shapes, dipped into melted fondant of different
flavors, and when cool coated with chocolate.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>Dates and raisins chopped fine and worked
into fondant make excellent centers. Mix some
chopped dates with maple fondant for these
centers. Chopped dates and chopped figs or raisins
combined and worked into maple fondant are
delicious.</p>

<p>California grapes dipped into melted fondant,
and then into melted chocolate make another
variety of creams.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chocolate Creams with Nut Centers</span></h3>

<p>Almonds, walnuts, pecans, hazelnuts, hickory-nuts,
peanuts and Brazil nuts can all be used in
making centers for chocolate cream candies. The
nuts should be first blanched. Put two cupfuls of
fondant in a double boiler and melt, add a teaspoonful
of lemon juice, stir over the fire until
melted; then take the nut meats, one by one, on
a candy dipper or fork and dip into the fondant.
Lay on oiled or paraffine paper until cold, then
dip into melted chocolate. The fondant may be
divided if preferred and flavored with different
flavors, and prepared with different colors. Cherry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
flavored fondant is excellent with almonds. Vanilla
goes well with most nuts, and many like
peppermint flavor with nuts. Maple flavored
fondant is always excellent with nuts.</p>

<p>Take equal quantities of chopped walnuts, hickory-nuts
and almonds. These should be chopped
fine. Take an equal amount of fondant and melt
in a double boiler, and stir in the nut meats; flavor
with vanilla if the fondant has not already been
flavored. When the fondant mixture begins to
harden mold into bonbon shape, and place on
paraffine paper or a sheet of clean tin. When
entirely cool coat with chocolate.</p>

<p>Delicious bonbons can be made by grinding up
pistachio nuts until fine, and mixing with an equal
quantity of pale green or white fondant flavored
with pistachio or almond. When cool enough
shape in bonbons, and coat with chocolate.</p>

<p>Chop equal quantities of almond nut meats and
candied cherries, or preserved cherries. Mix with
a little fondant, roll into balls and coat with chocolate,
and you have a delicious cream.</p>

<p>Take walnut meats and dip in melted fondant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
and when this has become firm dip in more
fondant of a different flavor and color. Repeat
this twice, then when cold coat with chocolate.
Any kind of nut meats may be used in the same
way.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">How to Coat Chocolate Creams</span></h3>

<p>Most confectioners use a bittersweet chocolate
with which they coat their chocolates; this may
be obtained at any good confectionery shop and
will cost about fifty cents a pound, but if this is
not obtainable a bittersweet chocolate can be
made by combining sweetened chocolate with
Baker's bitter chocolate. Use half and half of
each, and blend well together before dipping the
chocolates in it. Any one who likes the bitter
tang in the chocolates may use the bitter chocolate
by itself. A small amount of cocoa butter
may be added to the melted chocolate; this will
make it go further and add to the glossy effect
without being harmful.</p>

<p>Melt your chocolate in a double boiler, and
always be very careful not to get any water into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
it or it will not harden, but be messy and sticky.
Stir while melting and it will do so more quickly,
and the less heat it takes to melt the chocolate the
better. After the chocolate is melted it can be
placed in bowls or cups for dipping. There are
two or three ways of coating chocolate creams.
Most confectioners put the chocolate on with their
fingers, but if one does not care to do this they
can be dipped with a candy dipper or fork into
the melted chocolate. They may also be coated
with a thin bladed knife or spatula. If you are
going to put the chocolate on with the hands it
should be allowed to get nearly cool, and then
knead well. Only use a small portion at once or
it will get too hard, then you must work quickly
in a warm room. Use your right hand for coating,
and throw the centers into the chocolate with
your left. Work the chocolate up around the
centers quickly, and then drop on a waxed paper
or on clean, smooth tin. String up a little of the
chocolate on top and twirl with the fingers to
give that twist that is found on most bought
creams. For many dipping is much easier. Drop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
the centers into the melted chocolate, turn over,
lift out with wire dipper or fork, with a knife
scrape off any surplus chocolate and place on
waxed paper or on tin. Set in a cool place
immediately to harden. If a knife is used for
coating, place a little of the chocolate on oiled or
waxed paper, and place the centers on top of it;
this forms the bottoms. Then with a knife spread
chocolate over the sides, dipping the knife into the
chocolate until the centers are entirely coated. If
the chocolate hardens before all the creams are
dipped it can be melted again.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Bonbons Made with Cocoanut</span></h3>

<p>Cocoanut cubes are made by taking two cupfuls
of fondant and melting it in a double boiler, stir
in one cupful of grated cocoanut and mix in well.
Pour this into a square box lined with paraffine
paper; it should be about an inch thick. When
cold cut into squares. This cocoanut mixture
may be variously tinted and given unusual and
elusive flavors, and thus one may have a variety.
Another way to make cocoanut cubes is to melt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
some fondant and pour half of it in a square or
oblong box lined with paraffine paper. Then
cover this over with cocoanut a half inch, then
pour over the remainder of the fondant. This is
especially good if the fondant is colored rose or
pink. When cold cut into cubes.</p>

<p>A combination of chocolate fondant and cocoanut
is excellent. Melt a cupful of chocolate fondant
and pour into a square or oblong box lined
with paraffine paper. Melt a cup of pink or white
fondant in a double boiler and stir in one-half
cupful of cocoanut. Pour over the chocolate
fondant.</p>

<p>Snowballs can be made by taking one cupful
of fondant and melting it, then stir in one-half
cupful of grated cocoanut. Form into balls, roll
in beaten egg white and then roll in grated
cocoanut until thickly covered. Place on paraffine
paper until they harden.</p>

<p>Cocoanut drops are made by mixing with two
cupfuls of melted fondant one-half cupful of grated
cocoanut and one-fourth cupful of finely chopped
candied cherries. Add a teaspoonful of juice of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
maraschino cherries. Drop from a spoon on
paraffine paper, and press a candied cherry in the
center of each bonbon.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Nut Bonbons</span></h3>

<p>Divide some fondant into four parts. Color one
part pink, one part yellow, add to the third violet,
and to a fourth green pistachio coloring. Flavor
each portion with a different flavoring extract.
Take some halved walnut meats and blanch.
Form the fondant into round balls the size of
hickory-nuts; put a half walnut on each side of
the fondant ball and press them together so that
the fondant is between the two halves of the
walnuts. By using some chocolate fondant, some
maple fondant and some white fondant you can
have these bonbons in seven colors.</p>

<p>Chop up a half cupful each of almonds, pecans
and walnuts and mix with enough fondant to
make it of the right consistency to mold into
bonbon shape with the hands. Dip in melted
maple fondant, or chocolate fondant.</p>

<p>Chop up some almonds fine and mix with some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
fondant, using about a half cupful of nut meats to
each cupful of fondant, flavor with almond, and
pour into a square or oblong box lined with
paraffine paper. Melt some white fondant and
mix with it a half cupful of chopped candied
cherries, pour over the nut fondant, and when this
has cooled pour over another layer of nut fondant.
Cut into cubes and press an almond in some of the
cubes and candied cherries in others.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fruit Bonbons</span></h3>

<p>Remove the stones from nice large dates, fill
the cavities with fondant of different flavors and
colors. If preferred these may be dipped in fondant,
or left as they are. Prunes may be stuffed
with fondant or a fondant and nut mixture, and
then dipped in fondant of different colors. Chop
up some figs until fine, work into this an equal
quantity of nut meats. Roll up into balls; if not
moist enough add a little cream. Dip into melted
fondant. Raisins are also good prepared in this
manner. Dip into maple fondant.</p>

<p>Melt some fondant in a double boiler, and stir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
into it candied orange peel cut into tiny strips.
Pour in a lined box or greased square or oblong
pan. When partly cool mark off into squares and
decorate the top of each square with a tiny star
cut out of the candied orange peel. The fondant
should be flavored with orange. Candied lemon
peel can be used in the same way, and in this
case the fondant should be flavored with lemon.
When cool cut into squares. Candied cherries
can be cut up into bits and stirred into pale pink
fondant flavored with rose. Press little hearts cut
out of candied cherries in the center of each square.</p>

<p>To make a delicious fruit loaf melt one-half
cupful of fondant, add a half teaspoonful extract of
almond or vanilla, and stir in two tablespoonfuls of
candied cherries cut in quarters, and a tablespoonful
of chopped angelica. When mixed pour into
a lined candy box in an even layer. Melt one-half
cupful of chocolate fondant and stir into it one-fourth
cupful of chopped dates and flavor with
vanilla. Pour over the other layer in the box.
Melt one-half cupful of maple fondant and stir
into it one-fourth cupful of chopped nut meats,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
and pour over the other layers. Cover with
paraffine paper and set where it will cool quickly.
When firm, break down the sides of the box and
cut into slices or cubes. Any kind of fruit may be
used in the different layers.</p>

<p>Sections of oranges or tangerines may be dipped
in fondant, but one must be careful that they are
not broken in any way to let the juice escape as
this will probably soften the fondant and make it
messy.</p>

<p>Any preserved fruit, dried in the oven, cooled
and then dipped in different colored fondant
makes delicious bonbons. Preserved strawberries
can be dipped in fondant colored pink and flavored
with strawberry extract. Preserved cherries can
also be dipped in pink or white fondant flavored
with almond or cherry. Pears and yellow peaches
are good dipped in yellow fondant flavored with
lemon or orange. Quince preserves are also good
dipped.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Assorted Bonbons</span></h3>

<p>The plain white fondant flavored with vanilla
is good dipped in the pink, yellow, green or violet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
fondant, or in maple fondant; form the white fondant
in pretty bonbon shapes before dipping.</p>

<p>Pretty marbles can be made by taking a small
piece of two or more colored fondants in the hand
and rolling them around until they become smooth
and round and beautifully streaked with the different
colors. Place on paraffine paper and turn
often to prevent their flattening on one side, until
firmly set.</p>

<p>Roll out some of the different colored fondant
in sheets, place one upon the other, roll gently
with the rolling pin until the colors are blended
together, then cut into bars or squares.</p>

<p>Form fondant into tiny cones, tucking into each
cone a bit of preserved ginger, well dried before
using. Dip in different colored fondant. Some
can be dipped in melted chocolate also.</p>

<p>Work into a half cupful of fondant one teaspoonful
of ground cinnamon, flavor with a drop
or two of oil of cinnamon, and form into balls.
Dip these in chocolate fondant. Other spice bonbons
can be made by using a few drops of the oil of
allspice, cloves or nutmeg in flavoring the fondant.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>Peppermint and wintergreen wafers can be
made by taking some white fondant and coloring
it a pale green and flavoring it with peppermint
extract. Drop from a spoon on paper the size
of a quarter. Wintergreen wafers can be made
by coloring the fondant pink and flavoring with
wintergreen extract.</p>

<p>Take some fondant and flavor with orange and
color a deep yellow; roll out in a long strip about
two inches wide. Flavor some more fondant
with banana extract and color a light yellow.
Form this into a long round stick shape and place
in the center of strip. Bring the two edges of
the outside fondant together, and press together.
Cut off neatly with a knife in half-inch pieces
when cool.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">How to Dip with Fondant</span></h3>

<p>Just a word in regard to the dipping, and preparing
the fondant for dipping. Place the fondant
in a double boiler or in a bowl and place the
bowl in a saucepan of hot water. The fondant
should be melted to about the consistency of thick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
cream. Be careful that it does not get too hot or
it will become a syrup again. Stir occasionally
while melting and this will help it to melt not
only evenly, but more quickly. If the fondant is
very dry a few drops of water may be added, but
be very careful not to get too much water in or
the bonbons will not harden up well. When
ready to dip remove the fondant from the fire,
but let the bowl remain in the hot water. Take up
the centers to be dipped on a candy dipper or fork
and drop into the bowl, then lift them out, scrape
off any surplus fondant with a knife, and drop
on oiled or waxed paper or smooth tin slightly
oiled. These will harden very quickly. One can
make a twist on the top of them like the chocolates,
but this must be done just as soon as dipped.
The fondant can be flavored and colored in any
way desired while it is melting.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Oriental Bonbons</span></h3>

<p>These cream chocolates are more difficult to
make than the common chocolate creams, but one
is well repaid for the trouble for they are simply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
delicious. To make them take two cupfuls of
granulated sugar, one-half cupful of water, one-half
teaspoonful of glycerine and one-fourth teaspoonful
of cream of tartar or three drops acetic
acid. Stir until the sugar is dissolved, then wipe
down the sides of the kettle to remove all sugar
crystals. Boil to exactly 238 degrees, then pour
out on a platter or marble slab and flavor with
one-half teaspoonful of vanilla. Allow it to stand
undisturbed until all heat has left it, then place
over it the white of one egg beaten until very
stiff, then cream the batch as you do in making
fondant, but work it very slowly, as this gives it
more chance to become firm. If it is too soft to
work up in shape of bonbons, just let stand a little
while, and then shape. In molding remember the
less they are handled the easier they will be to
coat, as handling has a tendency to soften them.
Coat immediately after being molded, and this
must be done as quickly as possible. Place on
paraffine paper and let stand a day or so, and then
the centers will be like whipped cream, as the
white of egg will mellow the cream.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>POP-CORN SWEETS</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Excellent</span>, inexpensive and nourishing sweets
may be made with popped pop-corn. For making
these sweets the pop-corn kernels should be large,
crisp and with no hard centers. The best way to
pop corn to obtain these results is first to use good
pop-corn, then put enough corn in the popper
just to cover the bottom of popper. Pour some
cold water over it and hold the popper some distance
from the heat at first. Continue this for
three or four minutes, then place more directly
over the heat. The fire over which corn is popped
should be hot, even and steady. Shake the popper
quickly and steadily until nearly all the grains
have popped. When commencing to pop almost
every grain should pop open at once. The cold
water poured over the corn causes a steam to
generate; this makes the corn swell and burst open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
from the very center in large, crisp, fine flavored
kernels. If not ready to make the candy as soon
as the corn is popped store in paraffine bags or
glass jars and close up tightly, since popped corn
soon gets tough if exposed to dampness.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Molasses Pop-Corn Balls</span></h3>

<p>Take one cupful of light brown sugar and one
cupful of New Orleans molasses, half a cupful of
water and boil to the hard ball stage, then add
two tablespoonfuls of butter. Boil to the crack
stage, then add a half teaspoonful of soda and
pour over some freshly popped corn in a bowl.
Stir until the syrup is evenly distributed over the
corn, but be careful not to break the grains in doing
so. Dip the hands in water, take a portion of
the pop-corn up into the hands and press into nice
even round balls.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chocolate Pop-Corn Balls</span></h3>

<p>Pop some corn and pick out only the large
crisp, tender grains. Place in a saucepan two cupfuls
of granulated sugar, one-half cupful of water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
and one-fourth teaspoonful of cream of tartar.
Boil until it spins a thread or forms a hard ball
when dropped in cold water; then flavor with a
teaspoonful of vanilla. Pour part of this sugar
syrup over the pop-corn, stirring until the syrup
is evenly distributed through the pop-corn; while
doing this let the remainder stand on the back of
the stove. Form into tiny pop-corn balls with the
fingers, boil the remaining syrup to the crack
stage, then dip each ball into this, and place on
paraffine paper until cool. When cool dip into
melted sweet chocolate.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Snow Pop-Corn Balls</span></h3>

<p>Take two cupfuls of granulated sugar, one-half
cupful of white corn syrup, one-half cupful of water
and a pinch of cream of tartar. Boil to the soft ball
stage, then flavor with a few drops of peppermint
extract or a half teaspoonful of vanilla and pour
over the stiffly beaten whites of two eggs. Beat
up until light and it begins to harden, then stir in
two cupfuls of crisp pop-corn grains. Dip the
hands into corn-starch and mold while still warm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
into small balls. Roll each ball in cocoanut, and
then wrap in paraffine paper to keep their shape
until cold. Unwrap and heap on plate.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Ice Pop-Corn Balls</span></h3>

<p>Take two cupfuls of granulated sugar, one-half
cupful of water and one-fourth teaspoonful of
cream of tartar. Boil to the crack stage and pour
over pop-corn in a bowl, stirring until the syrup
is well mixed with the corn. Form into small
balls with the hands. While still warm roll the
balls in pulverized or finely chopped rock candy to
simulate ice.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Pop-Corn Dainty</span></h3>

<p>Place in a saucepan two cupfuls of granulated
sugar, one-half cupful of water and one-fourth teaspoonful
of cream of tartar. Boil to firm ball. Just
before removing from the fire stir into the syrup
a pint of pop-corn that has been run through the
food chopper. Pour over the stiffly beaten whites
of two eggs, flavor with a teaspoonful of vanilla and
beat up until light and foamy; then pour into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
greased pans, and cut into squares, or drop from a
spoon on paraffine paper, and press a whole pop-corn
grain into the top of each. These are also nice
if crystallized pop-corn in different colors is used
for decoration.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Crystallized Pop-Corn</span></h3>

<p>Take two cupfuls of granulated sugar, two tablespoonfuls
of white corn syrup and one-half cupful
of cream and boil to the soft ball stage.
Divide into four portions, pouring each portion
on a buttered plate, and flavoring differently with
strawberry, orange, maple and melted chocolate
respectively. Beat the portion on each plate
until creamy, coloring the portion that is flavored
with strawberry pink, the orange flavored with
yellow. One portion may be left white if liked, or
the amount of syrup may be doubled and divided
into more portions. Place each kind of the
mixture in cups or bowls. Select very large,
crisp kernels of corn and dip one by one into the
different mixtures until all is used. Dry them
on greased or waxed paper. One may use a hat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
pin to dip with. These grains may be used to
decorate other sweets or may be served in little
baskets or odd receptacles.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Pop-Corn Bars</span></h3>

<p>Take two cups of sugar, one-half cupful of
water and boil to the hard ball stage. Add
vanilla flavoring or any desired flavoring. Crush
some fresh pop-corn with a rolling pin, and stir
into the syrup. When the corn has been perfectly
mixed with the syrup press into a square or oblong
buttered pan to the depth of about an inch,
patting it smooth on top. When cool cut into
bars with a very sharp knife.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Maple Pop-Corn Bars</span></h3>

<p>Cook two cupfuls of maple sugar and one cupful
of cream to the hard ball stage. Beat up until it
begins to turn creamy, then stir in a pint of large,
crisp kernels. See that the syrup is well mixed
through the corn. Turn into a square or oblong
pan that has been well buttered and press until
flat on top, but not hard enough to crush the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
kernels. If liked it can be shaped into bars with
the hands, and there will not be so much danger
of crushing the kernels. If shaped in a pan cut
into bars with a sharp knife.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Pop-Corn Macaroons</span></h3>

<p>Run some freshly popped corn through the food
chopper, or else chop up with a knife until fine.
To a cupful of these add an equal quantity of
blanched almonds that have been pounded to a
paste. Put these together in a bowl. Beat up
whites of three eggs until stiff, then add about one-half
a cupful of sugar and beat up for about five
minutes. Mix the pop-corn and paste into this
slowly until thoroughly blended. Drop from a
spoon on oiled or buttered paper in a pan and
sprinkle with powdered sugar. Bake in a moderate
oven for about twenty minutes. The centers
of these can be decorated with crystallized pop-corn.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cherokee Crisp</span></h3>

<p>Take two cupfuls of light brown sugar, one-fourth
cupful of New Orleans molasses, and one-half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
cupful of water. Melt over the fire until all
the sugar is dissolved, add two tablespoonfuls of
butter. Sprinkle some salt over a quart of freshly
popped corn in a bowl. Flavor the syrup with a
teaspoonful of vanilla after it has reached the
hard crack stage and pour over the corn. Turn
out on a large platter or marble slab and work
until a very thin sheet. When cold break into
pieces.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Pop-Corn Almond Nougat</span></h3>

<p>Take two cupfuls of white sugar, one-fourth cupful
of water and one-fourth cupful of corn syrup.
Melt over the fire until the sugar is dissolved,
then stir in one cupful of chopped pop-corn and
one-half cupful of chopped almonds. Boil to the
hard crack stage, flavor with a little almond extract,
and pour over buttered pans in thin sheets.
When cold break into pieces or cut into squares
with a sharp knife.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Pop-Corn Brittle</span></h3>

<p>Take a cupful of granulated sugar, one cupful
of brown sugar, one-half cupful of golden corn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
syrup and one-fourth cupful of water. Melt to a
syrup, then boil to the hard ball stage, add one-fourth
cupful of butter and boil until it begins to
turn color or to the hard crack stage. Place in a
bowl two quarts of freshly popped corn and one
cupful chopped peanuts. Pour the syrup over the
corn and stir until all the kernels and nuts are
covered with it. If not to be so thick with pop-corn
and nuts use only a quart of pop-corn.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Pop-Corn Fudge</span></h3>

<p>Take two cupfuls of white sugar, one cupful of
milk, two tablespoonfuls of butter and a pinch
of salt. Boil to the soft ball stage. Flavor with
a half teaspoonful of almond extract, then stir in
one cupful of chopped pop-corn and one-half
cupful of chopped peanuts or any nuts desired.
Stir until creamy and pour out on buttered pans,
and when cool cut into squares.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>MACAROONS AND MISCELLANEOUS
SWEETS</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Under</span> this head you will find recipes for making
macaroons, which are closely allied to candies;
and a number of sweets not classified.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Almond Macaroons</span></h3>

<p>To the beaten whites of six eggs add eight
ounces of blanched and powdered almonds. With
the yolks of the eggs beat one pound of powdered
sugar; add the grated rinds of two lemons, a
little sliced citron and one-fourth pound of flour,
and mix well together. Beat lightly into this the
almond whip. Drop from a spoon on greased
paper, and bake in a moderate oven until done.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cream Macaroons</span></h3>

<p>Beat the whites and the yolks of six eggs
separately. Add to the yolks three pounds of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
powdered sugar and the same amount of flour.
Add the whites of the eggs and enough flavored
whipped cream to mix well; pour into molds, and
bake a delicate brown.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Jasmine Macaroons</span></h3>

<p>Into the whites of six eggs beaten until stiff
mix one cupful of powdered sugar; then beat
into this some jasmine flowers. Make into small
cakes, sprinkle with sugar, and bake in a moderate
oven.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Queen Macaroons</span></h3>

<p>Mix the beaten whites of six eggs with the
yolks of four; add one cupful of sugar and flour
and a small quantity of coriander seed. Drop from
a spoon on waxed paper and bake in a moderate
oven.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chocolate Macaroons</span></h3>

<p>Take one-fourth pound of grated chocolate,

two cupfuls of sugar and one-half cupful of water
and cook to a thick syrup, add a teaspoonful of
vanilla and part of the potato balls, dropping
them in carefully to prevent breaking. Let them
simmer until they are coated with a thick coating
and are transparent or clear. Remove one at a

manner their character is entirely changed, and
much improved.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Oriental Bonbons</span></h3>

<p>Soak a half pound of gum arabic in two cupfuls
of water until soft. Stir into it two cupfuls of
confectioner's sugar and cook over the fire in a

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CAKE CONFECTIONERY AND LITTLE
SWEETS</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Delicious</span> bonbons may be made with cake and
fondant, and then there are many little sweets
that are so closely allied to candies that they may
well be included in a book on candy-making. To
make these confections one needs to have fancy
little cake cutters of all kinds, such as heart, star,
round, diamond, leaf, bird and animal shapes. If
these are not readily obtained a tinsmith will make
them for you if you tell him just what you desire.
You will also need a pastry bag with a finely
pointed tube, and tiny gem pans.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Bonbon Cakes</span></h3>

<p>The cakes that are best for making bonbons
are the sponge cake, pound cake and angel food
cake: these should be at least twenty-four hours
old, and then can be cut up into any shape desired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
without breaking or crumbling. Scoop out little
balls, using a vegetable scoop, from any of these
cakes and dip in melted fondant flavored with
different flavors and colored in different colors.
If you are planning a luncheon or entertainment
it is nice to have these little cake bonbons to help
carry out the color scheme. Angel food cake cut
in fancy shapes and dipped into pink or rose fondant
flavored with rose extract is good. Sponge
cake is nice dipped into yellow fondant flavored
with orange or lemon, or into chocolate fondant.</p>

<p>These little cake bonbons can be made with
delicious fillings. Cut a sheet of angel food cake,
which should be about an inch thick, into tiny
hearts. With a small round cutter remove the
center of each, leaving the bottom one-fourth inch
thick. Fill this little hollow with candied pineapple
or any candied fruit mixed with a little
fondant, or with chopped nuts worked into a little
fondant. Then dip in red or pink fondant; these
are nice for St. Valentine's day or for bridal
occasions. Take some sponge cake and cut into
slices about an inch thick, cut out with a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
star-shaped cutter. Cut out half-way through
with a smaller star cutter. Fill these hollows in
with a chocolate custard. Spread a little white
of egg on edges of stars, and place two stars
together, then dip in yellow fondant, or chocolate
fondant. Dip these little cakes in the fondant
with a fork just as you would other bonbons and
drop on paraffine paper to harden.</p>

<p>Little rose confections can be made by dipping
small round cakes in rose colored fondant, and
laying on top of each a few candied rose petals,
arranged to look like a rose. Violet confections
can be made by cutting small round cakes out of
angel food cake, dipping them in violet fondant
and decorating the top with candied violets.</p>

<p>Cut tiny stars out of a thin sheet of angel food
cake or pound cake, dip in white fondant, and
cover the tops over with the tiny silver or gold
coated confectionery that one can obtain at the
confectionery shops, and you will have silver and
gold stars, which will be nice for Christmas. Cut
some sponge cake or pound cake into little squares,
dip into melted maple fondant, and decorate the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
top with halved walnuts, pecans or almonds. Cut
some sponge or pound cake into slices an inch
thick, then cut into cubes, make a little slit in one
side, slip in a bit of preserved ginger, candied
citron or orange rind. Dip in yellow fondant
flavored with lemon or orange. Cut out some
sponge cake to resemble sections of orange. Dip
in orange fondant flavored with orange.</p>

<p>Little heart shaped cakes dipped in pink or
white fondant and then decorated in the center
with little hearts cut out of candied cherries are
nice. Squares or rounds of angel food cake dipped
in fondant, and pressed with some sort of die, say
a wish-bone, horseshoe, swastika or flower, then
the impression made filled in with a different
colored fondant carefully piped in with the pastry
bag, are unique.</p>

<p>Cut out some of the cake with a leaf-shaped
cutter. Dip into a leaf-green fondant flavored
with pistachio, and you will have pretty cakes.
The leaf can be veined with chocolate put on with
the pastry bag and pipe.</p>

<p>Cut out some sponge cake in shape of dominoes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
dip in white fondant, and then mark the dots as
in dominoes with melted chocolate.</p>

<p>Slice some sponge cake a fourth of an inch thick,
and cut out with a cutter in small rounds. On
one-half of these cakes spread jelly of different
kinds, such as peach, currant, and raspberry. Put
the unspread cakes on these, and cover with
fondant. In flavoring the fondant use what combines
with the jelly used&mdash;almond flavoring with
the peach jelly, chocolate with currant and so on.
Use differently colored fondants and they will look
very pretty.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Spice Nuts</span></h3>

<p>Take two eggs, one cupful of granulated sugar,
one-fourth cupful of almond meats, one-fourth
cupful of citron, one-half teaspoonful each of cinnamon,
allspice and cloves, one cupful of flour,
and one teaspoonful of baking-powder. Cut the
nuts and citron up very fine. Sift the flour and
baking-powder together and mix with the nuts,
fruit and spices. Beat up the eggs and sugar
until light and thick, then gradually add the flour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
mixture. The dough should be stiff enough so
that it can be formed into little balls about the
size of a hickory-nut. If too stiff add a little
water, if not stiff enough add a little more flour
to make it of the right consistency. Drop on
buttered tins about an inch apart and bake in the
oven until a light brown.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chocolate Nuts</span></h3>

<p>Take one cupful of flour and add to it one
tablespoonful of baking-powder. Sift into a bowl
and add one cupful of sugar. Mix well together.

tablespoonful of hot water, add two teaspoonfuls
of vanilla and half a teaspoonful of soda. Beat
up two eggs, add the chocolate and one-fourth
cupful of melted butter. Work into the flour and
sugar mixture. The dough must be stiff enough
to form into balls the size of a hickory-nut. Drop
on greased tins an inch apart. When cool dip in
chocolate fondant.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Walnut Wafers</span></h3>

<p>Cream one cupful of butter with one and one-half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
cupfuls of sugar; add three beaten eggs;
put two cupfuls of chopped walnut meats into one
cupful of flour, and add this to the batter. Sift
one teaspoonful of baking-powder and one and
one-half cupfuls of flour together, and add at the
last. Drop by spoonfuls on buttered tins, dust
with granulated sugar, and put a whole walnut
meat on each one. Bake them in a moderate
oven.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Peanut Jumbles</span></h3>

<p>Take two tablespoonfuls of butter, one cupful
of sugar, one egg, half a teaspoonful of soda, one
teaspoonful of cream of tartar, one tablespoonful

peanuts. Bake separately the small rounds cut
from the center.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cocoanut Jumbles</span></h3>

<p>Beat half a cupful of butter and half a cupful
of sugar to a cream, flavor with a teaspoonful of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
vanilla, then add two eggs, a cupful of freshly
grated cocoanut, and two cupfuls of flour sifted
with a level teaspoonful of baking-powder. Pat
and roll out thin on a well-floured board, adding
more flour if needed. Flour a jumble cutter well
and cut into rings. Brush the tops of the cakes
with milk and sprinkle with a mixture of granulated
sugar and cocoanut. Place far enough
apart on buttered pan so that they will not touch
when baked. Bake in a rather hot oven until a
pale brown.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fruit Rocks</span></h3>

<p>Cream one cup of sugar with two-thirds cup of
butter, add one and a half cupfuls of flour, two
eggs, one cupful of English walnut meats, one
cupful of chopped raisins, one teaspoonful of cinnamon,
one teaspoonful of cream of tartar and
one-half teaspoonful of soda dissolved in a little
water. Drop by teaspoonfuls on buttered tins an
inch or more apart. Press one-half of an English
walnut meat or a raisin in the center of each, and
bake until a nice brown.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Raisin Spirals</span></h3>

<p>Mix together one cupful of butter and one cupful
of brown sugar until creamy, add two well-beaten
eggs, one-half cupful of sour milk and
scant teaspoonful of soda if the milk is thoroughly
sour, if not use only half a teaspoonful. Beat up
together, then add enough flour to make a dough
that will roll nicely but be careful not to get it
too stiff. Flour the board well, then roll out thin
and cut with a narrow oblong cutter. Put through
a food chopper one pound of stoned dates and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
one-half pound of figs. Work together and then
roll in a thin sheet. Put a layer of this fruit
paste between every two of the cakes in sandwich
fashion. Bake in a hot oven. Marmalades or
candied fruits or nut and fruit mixtures can be
used for these bars.</p>

inches long. Bake in a moderate oven for ten
minutes.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Ginger Wafers</span></h3>

<p>Stir one-fourth cupful of butter and one-half
cupful of sugar to a cream, add two eggs, the
whites and yolks beaten separately. Add a half
cupful of flour or just enough to make a thin
batter, mix well, then add one tablespoonful of
ginger, and the grated peel of a lemon. Drop by
spoonfuls on buttered tins, far enough apart not
to run together. Bake in a moderate oven, and
when half done roll up into little cylinders, and
return to the oven and crisp until brown.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Marshmallow Cakes</span></h3>

<p>Blanch and dry gently in the open oven sufficient
hickory-nut meats to fill three-fourths of a
cup. Cool and chop very finely. Beat three
eggs, yolks and whites together, until light. Add<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
the nuts, two tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar,
a half teaspoonful of orange extract and sufficient
flour to form a soft dough. Roll out on board
until about an inch in thickness and cut in small
diamonds that measure only two or three inches
from point to point. Lay on shallow greased tins
and bake to a pale brown in a moderate oven.
Frost with marshmallow icing while they are still
warm.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Ginger Nuts</span></h3>

<p>Take one pint of baking molasses and add one-half
cupful of melted butter, one cupful of brown

Stir these ingredients well together, and while
mixing add two tablespoonfuls of candied lemon
or orange peel, one tablespoonful of candied
angelica cut into small dice, and a teaspoonful
of soda dissolved in a little warm water. Having
mixed all thoroughly together break in one egg
and work in as much flour to form a paste just
stiff enough to handle. Form into balls, and
press a raisin or blanched almond in the top of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
each, and bake on greased tins in a rather quick
oven.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">German Ginger Balls</span></h3>

hot water. Melt the butter in the water, set over
the fire and bring to a gentle boil. Then put in
the flour and boil until it leaves the sides of the
saucepan, never ceasing to stir. One minute is
enough. Turn into a bowl to cool. Beat the
eggs in one at a time, beating one minute after
each egg is put in, and then when all are in beat
for two or three minutes. Set on ice for an hour,
then drop in spoonfuls on buttered paper, being
careful to get them far enough apart so that they
will not touch each other. Bake for about fifteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
minutes in a quick oven or until a nice brown.
When cool make a slit in the side of each and fill
with a cream nut filling made as follows: Place

water and add to the other ingredients. Add
enough sifted flour to make a drop batter. Drop
from spoon on greased pan, far enough not to
touch each other when baked. Dip each little
drop cake into melted chocolate fondant. The
dough should be stiff enough so that the batter
will not run over the pan but keep its shape when
baked. Try a bit of the batter in the oven before
putting in the cakes. These cakes should be baked
in a quick oven.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cocoanut Fruit Drops</span></h3>

one-fourth teaspoonful of salt. Stir well, then
add one-third cup of sweet milk or just enough
to form a dough that will roll out. Flour the
board and roll very thin. Cut out with a jumble
cutter or a doughnut cutter. Spread half of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>

Place the batter in a pastry bag and run it
out through the tube on light brown paper (not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
buttered), making each cake about a finger in
length, and about one-fourth inch wide; be careful
not to get them too wide. Sprinkle with
granulated sugar, bake in a quick oven. Place
the paper on a damp table and let stand a few
moments and the cakes can be readily removed.
Stick the cakes together back to back; this will
make them round like fingers. If liked a little
jelly may be spread between the cakes before putting
them together.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fruit Puffs</span></h3>

<p>Take five eggs and beat the whites and yolks
separately, stir in gradually one and a half cupfuls

the cakes and fill in with this fruit mixture.
Cover with icing or chocolate fondant.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Nut Tarts</span></h3>

<p>Prepare a short pastry crust, adding to the
flour one tablespoonful of powdered sugar. Roll
out very thin. Dip fancy cutters in flour and cut
the pastry, then pierce the half of the cakes with
a small circular cutter. Some of the cakes can
be made with one hole, some two and some three.
Place these on greased pans and bake in the oven
a pale brown. After removing make a paste
with the stiffly beaten whites of two eggs, two
tablespoonfuls of finely chopped nut meats, two
tablespoonfuls of maple sugar, and a little cream
if the paste is too thick to spread nicely. Spread
this on the cakes that have been left whole, and
then place the cakes with the holes on top. Fill
up the depressions or holes with jelly, marmalade
or fondant.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<div class='cap'>Some books are designed for
entertainment, others for information.
¶ This series combines both
features. The information is not only
complete and reliable, it is compact
and readable. In this busy, bustling
age it is required that the information
which books contain shall be ready to
hand and be presented in the clearest
and briefest manner possible. ¶ These volumes are replete
with valuable information, compact in form and unequalled
in point of merit and cheapness. They are the latest as
well as the best books on the subjects of which they treat.
No one who wishes to have a fund of general information
or who has the desire for self-improvement can afford to be
without them. ¶ They are 6 x 4½ inches in size, well
printed on good paper, handsomely bound in green cloth
with a heavy paper wrapper to match.</div>

<div class='adtitle2'>ETIQUETTE</div>

<div class='center'>By Agnes H. Morton</div>

<p>There is no passport to good society
like good manners. ¶ Even though one
possess wealth and intelligence, his success
in life may be marred by ignorance of social customs.
¶ A perusal of this book will prevent such blunders. It is
a book for everybody, for the social leaders as well as for
those less ambitious. ¶ The subject is presented in a bright
and interesting manner, and represents the latest vogue.</p>


<div class='adtitle2'>LETTER WRITING</div>

<div class='center'>By Agnes H. Morton</div>

<p>Why do most persons dislike to
write letters? Is it not because
they cannot say the right thing in
the right place? This admirable book not only shows by
numerous examples just what kind of letters to write, but by
directions and suggestions enables the reader to become an
accomplished original letter writer. ¶ There are forms for all
kinds of business and social letters, including invitations,
acceptances, letters of sympathy, congratulations, and love
letters.</p>


<div class='adtitle2'>QUOTATIONS</div>

<div class='center'>By Agnes H. Morton</div>

<p>A clever compilation of pithy quotations,
selected from a great variety of
sources, and alphabetically arranged
according to the sentiment. ¶ In addition to all the popular
quotations in current use, it contains many rare bits of prose
and verse not generally found in similar collections. ¶ One
important feature of the book is found in the characteristic
lines from well known authors, in which the familiar sayings
are credited to their original sources.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>


<div class='adtitle2'>EPITAPHS</div>

<div class='center'>By Frederic W. Unger</div>

<p>Even death has its humorous side.
¶ There are said to be "sermons in
stones," but when they are tombstones
there is many a smile mixed with the moral. ¶ Usually
churchyard humor is all the more delightful because it is
unconscious, but there are times when it is intentional and
none the less amusing. ¶ Of epitaphs, old and new, this
book contains the best. It is full of quaint bits of obituary
fancy, with a touch of the gruesome here and there for a
relish.</p>


<div class='adtitle2'>PROVERBS</div>

<div class='center'>By John H. Bechtel</div>

<p>The genius, wit, and spirit of a nation
are discovered in its proverbs, and the
condensed wisdom of all ages and all
nations is embodied in them. ¶ A good proverb that fits
the case is often a convincing argument. ¶ This volume
contains a representative collection of proverbs, old and new,
and the indexes, topical and alphabetical, enable one to find
readily just what he requires.</p>


<div class='adtitle2'>THINGS WORTH
KNOWING</div>

<div class='center'>By John H. Bechtel</div>

<p>Can you name the coldest place in
the United States or tell what year
had 445 days? Do you know
how soon the coal fields of the
world are likely to be exhausted, or how the speed of a
moving train may be told? What should you do first if
you got a cinder in your eye, or your neighbor's baby swallowed
a pin? This unique, up-to-date book answers thousands
of just such interesting and useful questions.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>


<div class='adtitle2'>DANCES OF TODAY</div>

<div class='center'>By Albert W. Newman</div>

<p>A book from which anyone
may learn the modern dances
without a teacher. ¶ A complete
diagram is given for each step, showing exactly
where the feet are placed on the floor at each beat in
the music. ¶ The many illustrations are also a help.
Among the dances described are the various Tangoes,
One Steps, Bostons and Maxixes, Hesitation Waltzes,
Grape-Vine, Turkey-Trot, Castle Walk, Lame Duck,
Texas Tommy and Gaby Glide.</p>
